## Machine Learning Coursework: Understanding ML Fundamentals
## Project Overview
This project serves as an integral component of my coursework, designed to deepen my understanding of machine learning (ML) fundamentals through direct application on the Wine dataset. The dataset categorizes three different types of Italian wines using 13 distinct features, offering a rich playground for exploring data analysis, visualization, and classification techniques.

## Objectives
To gain practical experience in implementing machine learning methods from scratch, focusing on the k-nearest neighbours (kNN) algorithm and nested cross-validation without the assistance of high-level ML libraries.
To understand and apply the principles of data visualization, making use of Python's plotting libraries to explore interactions between features of the Wine dataset.
To engage in hands-on parameter selection, model evaluation, and the development of a nuanced understanding of ML model performance metrics.

## Key Components
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting an initial exploration of the Wine dataset to identify patterns, relationships, and anomalies among the features.
Custom ML Implementations: Writing custom code for kNN and cross-validation processes, providing a clear window into the inner workings of these algorithms.
Data Visualization: Creating detailed plots to visualize the dataset, including scatter plots for feature interactions and histograms for feature distributions.
Evaluation and Analysis: Assessing model performance with a focus on understanding the implications of different parameter choices and the outcomes of the nested cross-validation process.

## Tools and Technologies
Python: The core programming language used for data manipulation, algorithm implementation, and plotting.
Pandas and NumPy: Essential for data manipulation and numerical operations.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Employed for creating informative and intuitive visualizations of the dataset and analysis results.

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I have not only solidified my understanding of key machine learning concepts but also developed a critical eye for evaluating model performance and a hands-on approach to problem-solving in the realm of data science. This coursework has been a pivotal step in my journey, reinforcing the importance of foundational knowledge in the field of machine learning.
